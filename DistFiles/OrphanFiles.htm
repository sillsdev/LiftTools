<h3>Orphan Files Report</h3>
<p>This tool walks through a single LIFT dictionary file, looking for entries which look like they contain audio or images. The audio and pictures folders are then searched to see if the linked file is there or not.  The report displays errors for links without files, and also files without links.</p>

<h3>Risks</h3>
<p>No risk to the lift file itself, as this is only read to get the names of the audio and image files.</p>

<h3>Authors</h3>
<p>Uses the Palaso library, whose authors include Eric Albright, Tim Armstrong, John Hatton, &amp; Cambell Prince.</p></body></html>
