<h3>Writing Systems</h3>
<p>This tool walks through a single LIFT dictionary file, reporting on Writing Systems lang tags in use.  The LDML Writing System repository is checked to see if all these tags exist, with the correct file name.  You can rename writing systems (and related data in the lift file), and delete unused writing systems files.</p>

<p>This tool can be configured under the config tab. By default the tool reports on what could be done.  Use the checkboxes to enable the various fixes.
</p>

<h3>Risks</h3>
<p>The input lift file is not modified, if the fixes are enabled the modified lift is saved as [filename].processed.lift.  LDML files can be deleted by this tool, so make a backup first.</p>

<h3>Authors</h3>
<p>Uses the Palaso library, whose authors include Eric Albright, Tim Armstrong, John Hatton, &amp; Cambell Prince.</p></body></html>
