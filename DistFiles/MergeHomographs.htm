<h3>Merge Homographs</h3>

<p>This tool walks through a single LIFT dictionary file, looking for entries which look like homographs.&#160; When it finds them, it looks to see if they can be merged.&#160; If they can, it then looks at the individual senses, and sees if they should be merged, too.</p>

<h3>Risks</h3>

<p>An undiscovered bug in this tool could cause information to be lost when two entries, or two senses, are merged. </p>

<h3>Authors</h3>

<p>Uses the Palaso library, whose authors include Eric Albright, Tim Armstrong, John Hatton, &amp; Cambell Prince.</p></body></html>
